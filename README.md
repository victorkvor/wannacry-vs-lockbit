  <h3 align="center">Comparative Analysis of Ransomware: WannaCry and LockBit 3.0</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This repository is based on my Bachelor's Thesis for my Computer Engineering degree at the University of Valencia and contains all my findings, reports, and scripts of two ransomware families: <b>WannaCry</b> and <b>LockBit 3.0</b>, with a reverse engineering approach.
The goal is to expose in-depth the mechanisms of evasion, persistence, obfuscation, and propagation, employed by both malware samples in order to make an evolutionary comparison of how the ransomware improved from WannaCry (2017) to LockBit 3.0 (2022). Also, both samples will be completely analysed, besides the encryption process, as it was not relevant for the project.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üîé About The Project <a id="about-the-project"></a>
  <p align="justify">
    This repository based on my Bachelor's Thesis presents a comprehensive technical and documente study that compares two major ransomware families from different eras: WannaCry (2017) and LockBit 3.0 (2022). The research follows a reverse engineering process, employing both static and dynamic analysis techniques to dissect malware samples and thoroughly analyze the program's workflow, exposing its behavior. Special attention is given to anti-debugging techniques, lateral movement, obfuscation methods, persistence mechanisms, process and service termination, dynamic payload loading, backup deletion, and log clearance.

The analysis is conducted primarily using open-source and freeware tools, including disassemblers, debuggers, network sniffers, process monitors, and auxiliary programs that assist in the reverse engineering process. All analysis is performed within a virtual machine to isolate the lab environment from the host system, providing a solid protection barrier against accidental infection.
    
Ultimately, beyond documenting and justifying the workflow of the malware samples, this research also provides practical detection mechanisms through YARA rules, which are designed to detect specific patterns that trigger the rule. Additionally, the techniques used by the malware samples are classified into tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

#### üíª VirtualBox - Windows 10 Pro (VM) <a id="vbox"></a>
VirtualBox is a type 2 hypervisor and open-source software that, thanks to its ease of use and strong community support, was chosen as the optimal solution for virtual machine virtualization. An isolated environment is necessary to safely contain the malicious behavior of ransomware samples, while also ensuring no network connection (manually configured). A Windows 10 Pro virtual machine is used because it was the contemporary operating system for the malware samples and is compatible with all tools employed in the lab environment.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### üß∞ Tools <a id="tools"></a>
- **Ghidra:** Ghidra is an open-source reverse engineering framework developed and maintained by the NSA, which enables the disassembly and decompilation of binary files. It stands out as an excellent alternative to commercial tools like IDA Pro or Binary Ninja, being completely free and supported by an active community, making it an ideal entry-level solution for malware analysis.

- **x64dbg/x32dbg:** x64dbg and x32dbg are open-source debuggers for Windows that support 64-bit and 32-bit applications, respectively. These tools allow the use of breakpoints, memory and register inspection, and controlled execution of a program. Compared to older debuggers like OllyDbg, they are more robust and benefit from continuous support and updates.

- **Process Hacker:** Process Hacker is an open-source system monitoring tool designed to inspect running processes and services, loaded libraries, and active privileges and tokens. Compared to proprietary alternatives like Microsoft‚Äôs Process Explorer, Process Hacker provides more detailed insights and offers greater transparency into everything being executed on the system.

- **Wireshark:** Wireshark is the standard tool for network analysis. It is an open-source packet sniffer that provides advanced filtering, protocol decoding, real-time capture capabilities, and support for hundreds of network protocols. It is essential for analyzing malware-related network activity, such as data exfiltration or propagation attempts.

- **Detect It Easy (DIE):** Detect It Easy is an open-source, lightweight tool with an intuitive interface designed to provide preliminary context of a binary before in-depth analysis. It can detect if an executable is packed, identify its programming language based on signatures, and visualize its entropy level. Currently, there is no comparable alternative that offers such a quick and efficient general overview of an executable.

- **Resource Hacker:** Resource Hacker is a freeware utility used to extract embedded resources from executables. Although it is not open-source, its simplicity and effectiveness make it the most suitable tool for this specific task.

- **HxD:** HxD is a lightweight hexadecimal editor used to analyze and modify the raw binary content of files. Although it is not open-source, it was chosen for this project due to familiarity with the tool. However, reliable open-source alternatives, such as ImHex, are also available.

- **Visual Studio Code & Visual Studio:** Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor known for its versatility and extensive support for extensions, making it essential for writing auxiliary Python scripts. In contrast, Visual Studio is a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) used to compile C/C++ programs, which is useful to replicate malware functionalities that rely on C++ functions.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis: WannaCry (2017) vs LockBit 3.0 (2022) <a id="comparative"></a>

| Aspect | **WannaCry (2017)** | **LockBit 3.0 (2022)** |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **üìÖ Context of Appearance** | First major ransomware to exploit SMB vulnerabilities in Windows (EternalBlue). | Highly sophisticated and modular Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), part of the professionalization of cybercrime. |
| **üíº Business Model** | Massive, indiscriminate attack without victim targeting or customization. | RaaS model with affiliates. Targeted attacks against specific organizations with double extortion (encryption + data leak). |
| **üîÅ Propagation Method** | Worm-like self-propagation via EternalBlue over LAN/WAN; also spread manually (phishing, RATs, etc.). | Manual propagation via phishing, RDP service exploitation, and internal tools. Occasional self-propagation in networks with shared administrator credentials in Active Directory. |
| **üß™ Technical Evolution** | Simple code, static analysis sufficient. Direct API usage. | Highly evolved: versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. Requires dynamic analysis due to advanced evasion techniques. |
| **üß± Language and Architecture** | Written in C++, for Windows x86/x64 systems. Size: 3.55 MB. | Written in assembly, for Windows x86/x64 systems. Size: 146 KB. |
| **üîê Encryption Techniques** | Basic, inefficient encryption scheme. | Fast, efficient, and more advanced encryption engine. |
| **üß® Exploits** | Uses EternalBlue and DoublePulsar (zero-day exploits leaked by ShadowBrokers). | Exploits ICM LuaUtil for UAC bypass. Less reliant on exploits, more on credentials and manual access. |
| **üé≠ Evasion and Stealth** | Basic techniques: hides working folder, uses legitimate service names, minimal obfuscation, and conventional compression. | Advanced techniques: obfuscation, non-standard encrypted/compressed payloads, anti-debugging, indirect API loading, EDR evasion (Sophos/Defender), and UAC privilege escalation. |
| **üì¶ Post-Infection Behavior** | Displays ransom note and encrypts files. No additional actions. | Encrypts and exfiltrates sensitive data. Threatens to leak it if payment is not made (double extortion). |
| **üí∏ Payment Mechanism** | Bitcoin only. No payment panel. | Uses a dark web portal with untraceable cryptocurrencies like Monero. |
| **üõ°Ô∏è Response and Mitigation** | MS17-010 patch, disable SMBv1, basic YARA rules, network segmentation. | Hard to mitigate. Variants evade YARA rules and signatures. Requires EDR/XDR solutions with up-to-date threat intelligence. |
